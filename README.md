# Case-Study-Cyclistic
This repository contains an analysis done for the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered on Coursera.

Within this case study, I used data from a fictional bike rental company called Cyclist in Chicago to determine and understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, in turn, coming up with recommendations for the marketing team to efficiently turn more casual riders into annual members, hence maximizing the growth of the company.
